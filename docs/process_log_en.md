## 📄 Verified Reports
Actual verification results using NotebookLM are summarized in the following report:
- [NotebookLM Verification Report (Grounding Report)](./reviews/notebooklm_validation_report_en.md)

This document records the behind-the-scenes (backyard) story of how an AI agent and a human constructed the cross-disciplinary theory "C-SMC (Cognitive Sliding Mode Control)."

## 🎬 Timeline

### 1. The Spark
- **Human:** Presented the hypothesis: "Can we model the recall process as a bistable system (Double-Well) and prevent panic by applying SMC from control theory?"
- **AI:** Discovered that SMC's "Invariance" and "Boundary Layer" correspond mathematically to cognitive "Resilience" and "Flexibility," and proposed the outline of the theory.

### 2. Mathematical Architecture
- **AI:** Defined state equations capable of control system design based on DDM (Drift Diffusion Model).
- **Human:** Provided feedback to reflect the time sensation of "mind going blank" in real life (several seconds to several minutes) in simulation parameters.
- **AI:** Reproduced 4 stages of trial and error (Phase 1-4) on simulation and technically argued "why derivative terms are harmful" and "why a boundary layer is necessary."

### 3. Grounding & The Hell of Peer Review
- **AI & Human:** Utilized NotebookLM to check consistency with existing cognitive science literature like Arnsten.
- **AI (The Destroyer):** Introduced a process where "AI destroys the logic generated by AI." The AI descended as a **"Hyper-Strict Control Theory Authority (Reviewer A)"** and thoroughly abused and attacked its own manuscript, saying "The model is too simple" or "The interpretation of chattering is naive from an engineering and cognitive science perspective."
- **AI (The Defender):** Faced this attack head-on and corrected/mathematically reinforced insufficient logic (e.g., effect of derivative term, risk of time delay). Through this "Spiral of Self-Criticism," it was refined into a "Forged Theory" rather than just empty theory.
- **Result:** Through this "Hell of Peer Review," problems with observation noise and the idea of defining cognitive flexibility as a boundary layer came to have stronger scientific grounds.

### 4. Drafting
- **AI:** Structured into a strict format as a scientific paper (from Abstract to Conclusion).
- **Human:** Adjusted the balance between "Engineering Coolness" and "Cognitive Science Human Touch," and concretized the social implementation concept (Fig 8).

### 5. Final Verification and Project Completion (Final Verification: Rev9 Diamond Master)
- **Problem:** Initially, there were serious inconsistencies between the descriptions in the paper and the provided source files (PDF), such as dataset mix-ups (Gjoreski vs Schmidt) and absence of cited literature (Edwards/Brehmer).
- **Solution:** Through multiple iterations (Rev3 -> Rev9), the following corrections were completed.
    1.  **Dataset:** Completely unified to Schmidt et al. (WESAD).
    2.  **DDM Literature:** Replaced inaccessible literature with Fischer et al. (2012) and confirmed context match.
    3.  **SMC Theory:** Added Slotine & Li (1991) source to support boundary layer theory description.
- **Conclusion:** The final version `draft_jp_rev9.md` (and its English translation `draft_en_rev9.md`) was completed as **"Diamond Master" (Fully Grounded)** supported by all provided source files.

## 🛠 Design Guidelines for Dialogue with AI
In this project, AI was utilized not just as a "Scribe," but in the following roles:

- **Logical Architect:** Converting abstract ideas into equivalent mathematical circuits.
- **Devil's Advocate:** Increasing robustness by daring to poke at the weaknesses of the proposed method (chattering, time delay, etc.).
- **Context Swiper:** Rapidly moving between the dictionaries of Control Engineering (Utkin, Slotine) and Cognitive Science (Ratcliff) to define new terms (Cognitive Chronology, etc.).

## 📈 Future Outlook
This process itself served as a Testbed where a single engineer gained the "Wings" of AI to be liberated from the Gravity of their area of expertise and leap into the unknown territory (Antigravity).
